### Hello! I'm Aaron.

## I am a full-stack developer who specializes in React and other JS frameworks.

I have recently got my certification from General Assembly for Software Engineering. I proficient in all of the technologies listed below, but have decided to focus on building applications using React. I have a background in Video Effects Editing and Esports, so I have a strong interest in plugins and game development as well.
